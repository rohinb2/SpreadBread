# SpreadBread

An application centered around connecting volunteers with restaurants and homeless shelters to help the underprivileged community and encourage collaboration amongst businesses, students, and student organizations. The competition aspect of the service allows members to 'compete' for points and be rewarded for their work. This can encourage competition amongst organizations and amongst students.
