# SpreadBread

An application centered around connecting volunteers with restaurants and homeless shelters to help the underprivileged community and encourage collaboration amongst businesses, students, and student organizations. 

The competition aspect of the service allows members to 'compete' for points and be rewarded for their work. This can encourage competition amongst organizations and amongst students.

This app was a Hackathon project (explains why there are so few commits), and won the PygHack Grand Prize in September 2017.
The hackathon was a joint project between myself, Brian Strauch (bstrauch24) and Rishi Masand (darthbatman).
